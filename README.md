    Introduction

In this post, I will be giving detailed instructions on how to run a KVM setup with GPU passthrough. This setup uses a Linux host installed with [Pop!\_OS 20.04](https://system76.com/pop) (kernel v5.4.0) and a guest VM running Windows 10.

    Considerations
</h3>

The main reason I wanted to get this setup working was because I found myself tired of using a dual-boot setup. I wanted to launch a Windows VM specifically for gaming while still being able to use my Linux host for development work (simultaneously).

At this point, you might be wondering... Why not just game on Linux? This is definitely an option for many people, but not one that suited my particular needs. Gaming on Linux requires the use of tools like [Wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software)) which act as a compatabilty layer for translating Windows system calls to Linux system calls. On the other hand, a GPU passthrough setup utilizes [KVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine) as a hypervisor to launch individual VMs with specific hardware attached to them. Performance wise, there are pros and cons to each approach.<span name="return1"><sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup></span>

In this tutorial, I will create a GPU passthrough setup. Specifically, I will be passing through an NVIDIA GPU to my guest VM while using an AMD GPU for my host. You could easily substitute an iGPU for the host but I chose to use a dGPU for performance reasons.<span name="return2"><sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup></span>

<h3 name="hardware_requirements"> Hardware Requirements </h3>

You're going to need the following to achieve a high-performance VM:
- Two graphics cards.
- [Hardware that supports IOMMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IOMMU-supporting_hardware).
- A monitor with two inputs<span name="return3"><sup>[3](#footnote3)</sup></span> *or* multiple monitors.

If you haven't built a PC yet but want it to be KVM/VFIO-focused, check out [this list](https://passthroughpo.st/vfio-increments/) of parts suggested by The Passthrough Post.

    Part 1: Prerequisites
</h3>

Before we begin, let's install some necessary packages:

```
$ sudo apt install libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients qemu-kvm qemu-utils virt-manager ovmf
```

Restart your machine and boot into BIOS. Enable a feature called `IOMMU`. You'll also need to enable CPU virtualization. For Intel processors, look for something called `VT-d`. For AMD, look for something called `AMD-Vi`. My motherboard is unique so I had to enable a feature called `SVM Mode`. Save any changes and restart the machine.

Once you've booted into the host, make sure that IOMMU is enabled:
`$ dmesg | grep IOMMU`

Also check that CPU virtualization is enabled:<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Intel: `$ dmesg | grep VT-d` <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For AMD: `$ dmesg | grep AMD-Vi`

Now you're going to need to pass the hardware-enabled IOMMU functionality into the kernel as a [kernel parameter](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/kernel_parameters). For our purposes, it makes the most sense to enable this feature at boot-time. Depending on your boot-loader (i.e. grub, systemd, rEFInd), you'll have to modify a specific configuration file. Since my machine uses systemd and these configuration files are often overwritten on updates, I will be using a tool called [kernelstub](https://github.com/pop-os/kernelstub):

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Intel: `$ sudo kernelstub --add-options "intel_iommu=on"`<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For AMD: `$ sudo kernelstub --add-options "amd_iommu=on"`

Similarly, if your system is configured with [GRUB2](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2), you can achieve the same result by editing the `/etc/default/grub` file with sudo permissions and including the kernel parameter as follows:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Intel: `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash intel_iommu=on"`<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For AMD: `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash amd_iommu=on"`

When planning my GPU passthrough setup, I discovered that many tutorials at this point will go ahead and have you blacklist the nvidia/amd drivers. The logic stems from the fact that since the native drivers can't attach to the GPU at boot-time, the GPU will be freed-up and available to bind to the vfio drivers instead. Most tutorials will have you add a kernel parameter called `pci-stub` with the [PCI bus ID](https://wiki.debian.org/HowToIdentifyADevice/PCI) of your GPU to achieve this. I found that this solution wasn't suitable for me. I prefer to dynamically unbind the nvidia/amd drivers and bind the vfio drivers right before the VM starts and subsequently reversing these actions when the VM stops ([see Part 2](#part2)). That way, whenever the VM isn't in use, the GPU is available to the host machine to do work on its native drivers.<span name="return4"><sup>[4](#footnote4)</sup></span>

Next, we need to determine the IOMMU groups of the graphics card we want to pass through to the VM. For those of you who don't already know, [IOMMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input%E2%80%93output_memory_management_unit) refers to the chipset device that maps virtual addresses to physical addresses on your I/O devices (i.e. GPU, disk, etc.). Its function is analogous to the memory management unit ([MMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit)) that maps virtual addresses to physical addresses on your CPU.

We want to make sure that our system has an appropriate IOMMU grouping scheme. Essentially, we need to remember that devices residing within the same IOMMU group need to be passed through to the VM (they can't be separated). To determine your IOMMU grouping, use the following script:

`iommu.sh`:
```
#!/bin/bash
for d in /sys/kernel/iommu_groups/*/devices/*; do
  n=${d#*/iommu_groups/*}; n=${n%%/*}
  printf 'IOMMU Group %s ' "$n"
  lspci -nns "${d##*/}"
done
```

For Intel systems, here's some sample output:

```
...
IOMMU Group 1 00:01.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v5/E3-1500 v5/6th Gen Core Processor PCIe Controller (x16) [8086:1901] (rev 07)
IOMMU Group 1 00:01.1 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation Xeon E3-1200 v5/E3-1500 v5/6th Gen Core Processor PCIe Controller (x8) [8086:1905] (rev 07)
IOMMU Group 1 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation TU102 [GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Rev. A] [10de:1e07] (rev a1)
IOMMU Group 1 01:00.1 Audio device [0403]: NVIDIA Corporation TU102 High Definition Audio Controller [10de:10f7] (rev a1)
IOMMU Group 1 01:00.2 USB controller [0c03]: NVIDIA Corporation TU102 USB 3.1 Controller [10de:1ad6] (rev a1)

IOMMU Group 1 02:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Ellesmere [Radeon RX 470/480/570/570X/580/580X/590] [1002:67df] (rev e1)
IOMMU Group 1 02:00.1 Audio device [0403]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Ellesmere HDMI Audio [Radeon RX 470/480 / 570/580/590] [1002:aaf0]
...
```

Here we see that both the NVIDIA and AMD GPUs reside in IOMMU group 1. This presents a problem. If you want to use the AMD GPU for the host machine while passing through the NVIDIA GPU to the guest VM, you need to figure out a way to separate their IOMMU groups.

1. One possible solution is to switch the PCI slot to which the AMD graphics card is attached. This may or may not produce the desired solution.
2. An alternative solution is something called the [ACS Override Patch](https://queuecumber.gitlab.io/linux-acs-override/). For an in-depth discussion, it's definitely worth checking out this post from [Alex Williamson](https://vfio.blogspot.com/2014/08/iommu-groups-inside-and-out.html). Make sure to consider the risks.<span name="return5"><sup>[5](#footnote5)</sup></span>

For my system, I was lucky<span name="return6"><sup>[6](#footnote6)</sup></span> because the NVIDIA and AMD GPUs resided in different IOMMU groups:

```
...
IOMMU Group 28 0a:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation TU102 [GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Rev. A] [10de:1e07] (rev a1)
IOMMU Group 28 0a:00.1 Audio device [0403]: NVIDIA Corporation TU102 High Definition Audio Controller [10de:10f7] (rev a1)
IOMMU Group 28 0a:00.2 USB controller [0c03]: NVIDIA Corporation TU102 USB 3.1 Controller [10de:1ad6] (rev a1)
IOMMU Group 28 0a:00.3 Serial bus controller [0c80]: NVIDIA Corporation TU102 UCSI Controller [10de:1ad7] (rev a1)
...

IOMMU Group 32 0d:00.1 Audio device [0403]: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Navi 10 HDMI Audio [1002:ab38]
...
```

If your setup is like mine<span name="return7"><sup>[7](#footnote7)</sup></span> and you had isolated IOMMU groups, feel free to skip the following section. Otherwise, please continue reading...

<h4 name="part 1.1">
    ACS Override Patch (Optional):
</h4>

For most linux distributions, the ACS Override Patch requires you to download the kernel source code, manually insert the ACS patch, compile + install the kernel, and then boot directly from the newly patched kernel.<span name="return8"><sup>[8](#footnote8)</sup></span>

Since I'm running a Debian-based distribution, I can use one of the [pre-compiled kernels](https://queuecumber.gitlab.io/linux-acs-override/) with the ACS patch already applied. After extracting the package contents, install the kernel and headers:

```
$ sudo dpkg -i linux-headers-5.3.0-acso_5.3.0-acso-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i linux-image-5.3.0-acso_5.3.0-acso-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i linux-libc-dev_5.3.0-acso-1_amd64.deb
```

Navigate to /boot and verify that you see the new initrd.img and vmlinuz:

```
$ ls
config-5.3.0-7625-generic    initrd.img-5.3.0-7625-generic  vmlinuz
config-5.3.0-acso            initrd.img-5.3.0-acso          vmlinuz-5.3.0-7625-generic
efi                          initrd.img.old                 vmlinuz-5.3.0-acso
initrd.img                   System.map-5.3.0-7625-generic  vmlinuz.old
initrd.img-5.3.0-24-generic  System.map-5.3.0-acso
```

We still have to copy the current kernel and initramfs image onto the ESP so that they are automatically loaded by EFI. We check the current configuration with [kernelstub](https://github.com/pop-os/kernelstub):

```
$ sudo kernelstub --print-config
kernelstub.Config    : INFO     Looking for configuration...
kernelstub           : INFO     System information:

    OS:..................Pop!_OS 19.10

kernelstub           : INFO     Configuration details:

   ESP Location:................../boot/efi
   Management Mode:...............True
   Install Loader configuration:..True
   Configuration version:.........3
```

You can see that the "Kernel Image Path" and the "Initrd Image Path" are symbolic links that point to the old kernel and initrd.

Let's change that:

```
$ sudo rm /boot/vmlinuz
$ sudo ln -s /boot/vmlinuz-5.3.0-acso /boot/vmlinuz
$ sudo rm /boot/initrd.img
$ sudo ln -s /boot/initrd.img-5.3.0-acso /boot/initrd.img
```

Verify that the symbolic links now point to the correct kernel and initrd images:

```

Finally, add the ACS Override Patch to your list of kernel parameter options:

```
$ sudo kernelstub --add-options "pcie_acs_override=downstream"
```

Reboot and verify that the IOMMU groups for your graphics cards are different:

```

<h4 name="part1.2">
    Download ISO files (Mandatory):
</h4>

Since we're building a Windows VM, we're going to need to download and use the virtIO drivers. [virtIO](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Virtio) is a virtualization standard for network and disk device drivers. Adding the virtIO drivers can be done by attaching its relevant ISO to the Windows VM during creation. Fedora provides the virtIO drivers for [direct download](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/creating-windows-virtual-machines-using-virtio-drivers/#virtio-win-direct-downloads).

Since I am passing through an entire NVMe SSD (1TB), I won't need to install any 3rd party drivers on top of the virtIO driver. Passing through the SSD as a PCI device lets Windows deal with it as a native NVMe device and therefore *should* offer better performance. If you choose to use a raw disk image instead, things are going to be a little different... Make sure to follow the instructions in [this guide](https://frdmtoplay.com/virtualizing-windows-7-or-linux-on-a-nvme-drive-with-vfio/#builddriveriso). The guide will show you how to add 3rd party drivers on top of the existing virtIO drivers by rebuilding the ISO.

For the final step, we're going to need to download the Windows 10 ISO from Microsoft which you can find [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO).

<h3 name="part2">
    Part 2: VM Logistics
</h3>

As mentioned earlier, we are going to dynamically bind the vfio drivers before the VM starts and unbind these drivers after the VM terminates. To achieve this, we're going to use [libvirt hooks](https://libvirt.org/hooks.html). Libvirt has a hook system that allows you to run commands on startup or shutdown of a VM. All relevant scripts are located within the following directory: `/etc/libvirt/hooks`. If the directory doesn't exist, go ahead and create it. Lucky for us, The Passthrough POST has a [hook helper tool](https://passthroughpo.st/simple-per-vm-libvirt-hooks-with-the-vfio-tools-hook-helper/) to make our lives easier. Run the following commands to install the hook manager and make it executable:

```
$ sudo wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PassthroughPOST/VFIO-Tools/master/libvirt_hooks/qemu' \
     -O /etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu
$ sudo chmod +x /etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu
```

Go ahead and restart libvirt to use the newly installed hook helper:

```
$ sudo service libvirtd restart
```

Let's look at the most important hooks:

```
# Before a VM is started, before resources are allocated:
/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu.d/$vmname/prepare/begin/*

# Before a VM is started, after resources are allocated:
/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu.d/$vmname/start/begin/*

# After a VM has started up:
/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu.d/$vmname/started/begin/*

# After a VM has shut down, before releasing its resources:
/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu.d/$vmname/stopped/end/*

# After a VM has shut down, after resources are released:
/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu.d/$vmname/release/end/*
```

If we place an executable script in one of these directories, the hook manager will take care of everything else. I've chosen to name my VM "win10" so I set up my directory structure like this:

```
$ tree /etc/libvirt/hooks/
/etc/libvirt/hooks/
├── qemu
└── qemu.d
    └── win10
        ├── prepare
        │   └── begin
        └── release
            └── end
```

It's time to get our hands dirty... Create a file named `kvm.conf` and place it under `/etc/libvirt/hooks/`. Add the following entries to the file:

```
## Virsh devices
VIRSH_GPU_VIDEO=pci_0000_0a_00_0
VIRSH_GPU_AUDIO=pci_0000_0a_00_1
VIRSH_GPU_USB=pci_0000_0a_00_2
VIRSH_GPU_SERIAL=pci_0000_0a_00_3
VIRSH_NVME_SSD=pci_0000_04_00_0
```

Make sure to substitute the correct bus addresses for the devices you'd like to passthrough to your VM (in my case a GPU and SSD). Just in case it's still unclear, you get the virsh PCI device IDs from the `iommu.sh` script's output. Translate the address for each device as follows: `IOMMU Group 1 01:00.0 ...` --> `VIRSH_...=pci_0000_01_00_0`. Now create two executable bash scripts:

`bind_vfio.sh`:
```
#!/bin/bash

## Load the config file
source "/etc/libvirt/hooks/kvm.conf"

## Load vfio
modprobe vfio
modprobe vfio_iommu_type1
modprobe vfio_pci

## Unbind gpu from nvidia and bind to vfio
virsh nodedev-detach $VIRSH_GPU_VIDEO
virsh nodedev-detach $VIRSH_GPU_AUDIO
virsh nodedev-detach $VIRSH_GPU_USB
virsh nodedev-detach $VIRSH_GPU_SERIAL
## Unbind ssd from nvme and bind to vfio
virsh nodedev-detach $VIRSH_NVME_SSD
```

`unbind_vfio.sh`:
```
#!/bin/bash

## Load the config file
source "/etc/libvirt/hooks/kvm.conf"

## Unbind gpu from vfio and bind to nvidia
virsh nodedev-reattach $VIRSH_GPU_VIDEO
virsh nodedev-reattach $VIRSH_GPU_AUDIO
virsh nodedev-reattach $VIRSH_GPU_USB
virsh nodedev-reattach $VIRSH_GPU_SERIAL
## Unbind ssd from vfio and bind to nvme
virsh nodedev-reattach $VIRSH_NVME_SSD

## Unload vfio
modprobe -r vfio_pci
modprobe -r vfio_iommu_type1
modprobe -r vfio
```

Place these scripts so that your directory structure looks like this:

```
$ tree /etc/libvirt/hooks/
/etc/libvirt/hooks/
├── kvm.conf
├── qemu
└── qemu.d
    └── win10
        ├── prepare
        │   └── begin
        │       └── bind_vfio.sh
        └── release
            └── end
                └── unbind_vfio.sh
```

We've succesfully created libvirt hook scripts to dynamically bind the vfio drivers before the VM starts and unbind these drivers after the VM terminates. At the moment, we're done messing around with libvirt hooks. We'll revisit this topic later on when we make performance tweaks to our VM ([see Part 4](#part4)).

    Part 3: Creating the VM
</h3>

We're ready to begin creating our VM. There are basically two options for how to achieve this: **(1)** If you prefer a GUI approach, then follow the rest of this tutorial. **(2)** If you prefer bash scripts, take a look at YuriAlek's series of [GPU passthrough scripts](https://gitlab.com/YuriAlek/vfio) and customize them to fit your needs. The main difference between these two methods lies with the fact that the scripting approach uses [bare QEMU](https://www.mankier.com/1/qemu) commands<span name="return9"><sup>[9](#footnote9)</sup></span>, while the GUI approach uses [virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org/). Virt-manager essentially builds on-top of the QEMU base-layer and adds other features/complexity.<span name="return10"><sup>[10](#footnote10)</sup></span>

Go ahead and start virt-manager from your list of applications. Select the button on the top left of the GUI to create a new VM:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/virtman_1.png" width="450">
</div><br>

Select the "Local install media" option. My ISOs are stored in my home directory `/home/user/.iso`, so I'll create a new pool and select the Windows 10 ISO from there:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/virtman_2.png" width="450">
</div><br>

Configure some custom RAM and CPU settings for your VM:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/virtman_3.png" width="450">
</div><br>

Next, the GUI asks us whether we want to enable storage for the VM. As already mentioned, my setup will be using SSD passthrough so I chose not to enable storage. You also have the option to create a raw disk image:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/virtman_4.png" width="450">
</div><br>

On the last step, review your settings and select a name for your VM. Make sure to select the checkbox "Customize configuration before installation" and click Finish:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/virtman_5.png" width="450">
</div><br>

A new window should appear with more advanced configuration options. You can alter these options through the GUI or the associated libvirt XML settings. Make sure that on the Overview page under Firmware you select `UEFI x86_64: /usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd`:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/virtman_6.png" width="450">
</div><br>

Go to the CPUs page and remove the check next to `Copy host CPU configuration` and under Model type `host-passthrough`. Also make sure to check the option for `Enable available CPU security flaw mitigations` to prevent against Spectre/Meltdown vulnerabilities.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/virtman_7.png" width="450">
</div><br>

I've chosen to remove several of the menu options that won't be useful to my setup (feel free to keep them if you'd like):

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/virtman_8.png" width="450">
</div><br>

Let's add the virtIO drivers. Click 'Add Hardware' and under 'Storage', create a custom storage device of type `CDROM`. Make sure to locate the ISO image for the virtIO drivers from earlier:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/virtman_9.png" width="450">
</div><br>

Under the NIC menu, change the device model to `virtIO` for improved networking performance:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/virtman_10.png" width="450">
</div><br>

Now it's time to configure our passthrough devices! Click 'Add Hardware' and under 'PCI Host Device', select the Bus IDs corresponding to your GPU.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/virtman_11.png" width="450">
</div><br>

Make sure to repeat this step for all the devices associated with your GPU in the same IOMMU group (usually VGA, audio controller, etc.):

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/virtman_12.png" width="450">
</div><br>

Since I'm passing through an entire disk to my VM, I selected the Bus ID corresponding to the 1TB Samsung NVMe SSD which has Windows 10 (and my games) installed on it.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/virtman_13.png" width="450">
</div><br>

Then under the 'Boot Options' menu, I added a check next to `Enable boot menu` and reorganized the devices so that I could boot directly from the 1TB SSD:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/virtman_14.png" width="450">
</div><br>

You can now go ahead and select the USB Host Devices you'd like to passthrough to your guest VM (usually a keyboard, mouse, etc.). Please note that these devices will be held by the guest VM from the moment it's created until it's stopped and will be unavailable to the host.<span name="return11"><sup>[11](#footnote11)</sup></span>

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/virtman_15.png" width="450">
</div><br>

Unfortunately, not everything we need can be accomplished within the virt-manager GUI. For the rest of this section, we'll have to do some fine-tuning by directly editing the XML (make sure to "Enable XML settings" under Edit -> Preferences -> General or use `$ sudo virsh edit win10` for a command-line approach):

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/virtman_16.png" width="450">
</div><br>

If you're like me and you're passing through an NVIDIA GPU to your VM, then you might run into the following common roadblock. [Error 43](https://passthroughpo.st/apply-error-43-workaround/) occurs because NVIDIA intentionally disables virtualization features on its GeForce line of cards. The way to deal with this is to have the hypervisor hide its existence. Inside the `hyperv` section, add a tag for `vendor_id` such that `state="on"` and `value` is any string up to 12 characters long:

```
<features>
    ...
    <hyperv>
        <relaxed state="on"/>
        <vapic state="on"/>
        <spinlocks state="on" retries="8191"/>
        <vendor_id state="on" value="kvm hyperv"/>
    </hyperv>
    ...
</features>
```

In addition, instruct the kvm to hide its state by adding the following code directly below the `hyperv` section:

```
<features>
    ...
    <hyperv>
        ...
    </hyperv>
    <kvm>
      <hidden state="on"/>
    </kvm>
    ...
</features>
```

Finally, if you're using QEMU 4.0 with the q35 chipset you also need to add the following code at the end of `<features>`:

```
<features>
    ...
    <ioapic driver="kvm"/>
</features>
```

Now you should have no issues with regards to the NVIDIA Error 43. Later on, we will be making more changes to the XML to achieve better performance ([see Part 4](#part4)). At this point however, you can apply the changes and select "Begin Installation" at the top left of the GUI. Please be aware that this may take several minutes to complete.

<h3 name="part4">
    Part 4: Improving VM Performance
</h3>

None of the following performance optimizations are necessary to get a working GPU passthrough system. However, these tweaks will make a difference if you're at all concerned about reaching buttery-smooth gaming performance. Though some of these changes are more difficult than others, I highly advise you to at least consider them.

<h4>
    Hugepages
</h4>

Memory (RAM) is divided up into basic segments called *pages*. By default, the x86 architecture has a page size of 4KB. CPUs utilize pages within the built in memory management unit ([MMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit)). Although the standard page size is suitable for many tasks, *hugepages* are a mechanism that allow the Linux kernel to take advantage of large amounts of memory with reduced overhead. Hugepages can vary in size anywhere from 2MB to 1GB. Hugepages are enabled by default but if they aren't, make sure to download the package: `$ sudo apt install hugepages`.<span name="return12"><sup>[12](#footnote12)</sup></span>

Go back to your VM's XML settings by either using the virt-man GUI or the command: `$ sudo virsh edit {vm-name}`. Insert the `memoryBacking` lines so that your configuration looks like this:

```
<memory unit="KiB">16777216</memory>
<currentMemory unit="KiB">16777216</currentMemory>
<memoryBacking>
    <hugepages/>
</memoryBacking>
```

Many tutorials will have you reserve hugepages for your guest VM at host boot-time. There's a significant downside to this approach: a portion of RAM will be unavailable to your host even when the VM is inactive. In my setup, I've chose to allocate hugepages before the VM starts and deallocate those pages on VM shutdown through the use of two additional executable scripts<span name="return13"><sup>[13](#footnote13)</sup></span> inside libvirt hooks ([see Part 2](#part2)):

```

                └── dealloc_hugepages.sh
```

`alloc_hugepages.sh`:
```
#!/bin/bash

## Load the config file
source "/etc/libvirt/hooks/kvm.conf"

## Calculate number of hugepages to allocate from memory (in MB)
HUGEPAGES="$(($MEMORY/$(($(grep Hugepagesize /proc/meminfo | awk '{print $2}')/1024))))"

echo "Allocating hugepages..."
echo $HUGEPAGES > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages

TRIES=0
while (( $ALLOC_PAGES != $HUGEPAGES && $TRIES < 1000 ))
do
    echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory            ## defrag ram
    echo $HUGEPAGES > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
    ALLOC_PAGES=$(cat /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages)
    echo "Succesfully allocated $ALLOC_PAGES / $HUGEPAGES"
    let TRIES+=1
done

if [ "$ALLOC_PAGES" -ne "$HUGEPAGES" ]
then
    echo "Not able to allocate all hugepages. Reverting..."
    echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
    exit 1
fi
```

`dealloc_hugepages.sh`
```
#!/bin/bash

## Load the config file

echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
```

<h4>
    CPU Governor
</h4>

This performance tweak<span name="return14"><sup>[14](#footnote14)</sup></span> takes advantage of the [CPU frequency scaling governor](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling#Scaling_governors) in Linux. It's a feature that is often ofterlooked in many passthrough tutorials, but we include it here because it's recommended. Once again, we'll be utilizing libvirt's hook system ([see Part 2](#part2)):

```
$ tree /etc/libvirt/hooks/
/etc/libvirt/hooks/
├── kvm.conf
├── qemu
└── qemu.d
    └── win10
        ├── prepare
        │   └── begin
        │       ├── ...
        │       └── cpu_mode_performance.sh
        └── release
            └── end
                ├── ...
                └── cpu_mode_ondemand.sh
```

`cpu_mode_performance.sh`:
```
#!/bin/bash

## Load the config file
source "/etc/libvirt/hooks/kvm.conf"

## Enable CPU governor performance mode
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
for file in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor; do echo "performance" > $file; done
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

```

`cpu_mode_ondemand.sh`:
```
#!/bin/bash

## Load the config file
source "/etc/libvirt/hooks/kvm.conf"

## Enable CPU governor on-demand mode
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
for file in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor; do echo "ondemand" > $file; done
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

<h4>
    CPU Pinning
</h4>

This performance tweak applies *only* to those of you whose processors are [multithreaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture)). My setup has an AMD Ryzen 9 3900X which has 12 physical cores and 24 threads (i.e. logical cores).

VMs are unable to distinguish between these physical and logical cores. From the guest's perspective, virt-manager sees that there are 24 virtual CPUs (vCPUs) available. From the host's perspective however, two virtual cores map to a single physical core on the CPU die.

It's **very important** that when we passthrough a core, we include its sibling. To get a sense of which cores are siblings, use the command `$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "core id"`. A matching core id means that the associated threads run on the same physical core.<span name="return15"><sup>[15](#footnote15)</sup></span>

If you're more of a visual learner, perhaps a diagram of your CPU architecture will help you visualize what's going on. Download the `hwloc` package with `$ sudo apt install hwloc`. Then simply type the command `$ lstopo`:

<div align="center">
    <img src="./img/lstopo.png" width="450">
</div><br>

It's time to edit the XML configuration of our VM. I've added the following lines of code (customize for your processor):

```
<vcpu placement="static">12</vcpu>
<iothreads>5</iothreads>
<cputune>
    <vcpupin vcpu="0" cpuset="6"/>
    <vcpupin vcpu="1" cpuset="18"/>
    <vcpupin vcpu="2" cpuset="7"/>
    <vcpupin vcpu="3" cpuset="19"/>
    <vcpupin vcpu="4" cpuset="8"/>
    <vcpupin vcpu="5" cpuset="20"/>
    <vcpupin vcpu="6" cpuset="9"/>
    <vcpupin vcpu="7" cpuset="21"/>
    <vcpupin vcpu="8" cpuset="10"/>
    <vcpupin vcpu="9" cpuset="22"/>
    <vcpupin vcpu="10" cpuset="11"/>
    <vcpupin vcpu="11" cpuset="23"/>
    <emulatorpin cpuset="0-1"/>
    <iothreadpin iothread='1' cpuset='2-3'/>
    <iothreadpin iothread='2' cpuset='4-5'/>
    <iothreadpin iothread='3' cpuset='12-13'/>
    <iothreadpin iothread='4' cpuset='14-15'/>
    <iothreadpin iothread='5' cpuset='16-17'/>
</cputune>
```

If you're wondering why I tuned my CPU configuration this way, I'll refer you to [this section](https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPUTuning) of the Libvirt domain XML format.<span name="return16"><sup>[16](#footnote16)</sup></span> More specifically, consider the differences between `vcpupin`, `emulatorpin`, and `iothreadpin`: 12 out of my 24 threads are assigned as vCPUs to the guest and from the remaining 12 cores assigned to the host, 2 threads are assigned to the emulator and 10 threads are assigned to handle IOThreads.

Go ahead and edit `<cpu>` to formally define the CPU topography of your VM. In my case, I'm allocating 1 socket with 6 physical cores and 2 threads per core:

```
<cpu mode="host-passthrough" check="none">
  <topology sockets="1" cores="6" threads="2"/>
  <cache mode='passthrough'/>
  <feature policy='require' name='topoext'/>
</cpu>
```

<h4>
    Hyper-V Enlightenments
</h4>

Hyper-V enlightenments help the guest VM handle virtualization tasks. [Libvirt](https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsFeatures) has a detailed breakdown of these features. I've chosen to go with the set of features recommended in [this tutorial](https://mathiashueber.com/performance-tweaks-gaming-on-virtual-machines/) due to hardware similarities:

```
<features>
    ...
    <hyperv>
      <relaxed state="on"/>
      <vapic state="on"/>
      <spinlocks state="on" retries="8191"/>
      <vendor_id state="on" value="kvm hyperv"/>
      <vpindex state='on'/>
      <synic state='on'/>
      <stimer state='on'/>
      <reset state='on'/>
      <frequencies state='on'/>
    </hyperv>
    ...
</features>
```

    Part 5: Benchmarks
</h3>

Congrats! You've finished setting up your Windows gaming VM! But now comes the most important part... Let's compare the bare-metal performance of Windows against our KVM. If everything goes according to plan, we can expect somewhat close to native performance on the VM. In order to test this theory, I used the following benchmark software: [UserBenchmark](https://www.userbenchmark.com/). Check out the results<span name="return17"><sup>[17](#footnote17)</sup></span> for yourself:

* [Windows Native](https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/25008533)
* [Windows KVM](https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/25008992)

Hopefully your results are as good as mine, if not better!

        Applying the ACS Override Patch <b>may compromise system security</b>. Check out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO/comments/bvif8d/official_reason_why_acs_override_patch_is_not_in/">this post</a> to see why the ACS patch will probably never make its way upstream to the mainline kernel.

        I'm actually being a bit disingenuous here... I deliberately purchased hardware that I knew would provide ACS implementation (and hence good IOMMU isolation). After flashing the most recent version of my motherboard's BIOS, I made sure to enable the following features under the "AMD CBS" menu: <code>ACS Enable</code>, <code>AER CAP</code>, <code>ARI Support</code>.

        AMD CPUs/motherboards/chipsets tend to provide better ACS support than their Intel counterparts. The Intel Xeon family of processors is a notable exception. Xeon is mainly targeted at non-consumer workstations and thus are an excellent choice for PCI/VGA passthrough. Be aware that they do demand a hefty price tag.

        For the sake of fairness, I chose to passthrough all 12-cores/24 threads to the KVM. That way, the bare-metal installation won't have an unfair advantage over the KVM when it comes to multi-core processes. Unfortunately, I couldn't passthrough all 32GB of RAM to the KVM since the host naturally reserves some of its own. In order to mitigate this as much as possible, I passed the remaining 29GB of RAM to the KVM. Due to its nature, a surplus of RAM doesn't really improve performance so much as it prevents bottlenecking.
